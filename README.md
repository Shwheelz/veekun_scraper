# veekun_scraper
Scrapes a single page of Veekun for Pokemon data

The veekun_scraper is a Ruby script that allows you to pull Pokemon names from Veekun and format them as JSON for easy access.  The .json file provided in this repository is a complete list of all of the Pokemon names from Veekun with the addition of the Mega forms omitted from the site at the time of my scrape.  If you would like to pull more information about certain Pokemon, such as type or base stats, the script is easy to edit and you can format the output file however you see fit. You should delete the contents of this .json file or specify a new output file if you choose to edit this script for your own use.
